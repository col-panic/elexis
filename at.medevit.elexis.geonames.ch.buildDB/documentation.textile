h1. Geo information CH creation package

This package creates a derby geo information database containing the zip codes, names of communities and streets of Switzerland.
The data used as a base for this is taken from the following sources:

|_. Dataset |_. Source |
| Communities | "MAT[CH]zip":https://match.post.ch/ - Data set PLZ Community |
| Zip codes | "MAT[CH]zip":https://match.post.ch/ - Data set PLZ Plus 1 |
| Streets | "BFS - Eidg. Geb√§ude- und Wohnungsregister":http://www.housing-stat.ch/de/dokumentation.html - Data set GWR Strassenliste, Ausgabe 01.12.2011 |

h2. How to build an updated data set

# Fetch the up-to-date files from the respective sources
# Convert the retrieved files to UTF-8, e.g. by using the @preparePlzPlus.sh@ in @rsc/match-zip@
# Modify the @buildDerbyDB.xml@ file to have the correct locations
# Modify @Main.java@ to have the correct locations
# Execute the @buildDerbyDB.xml@ to create an up-to-date @geoInfoCH.jar@ within the @lib@ directory
# Use the derby database contained within @geoInfoCH.jar@ to integrate into your specific plug-ins

h2. What to do with it?

Currently the generated @geoInfoCH.jar@ is being integrated as geoname provider into the new contact plugin. Please see
